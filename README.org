#+TITLE:    Quicklisp distribution by m-creations

* Introduction

This project contains the tiny pieces which are necessary to create a
[[http://quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]] distribution. We use this distribution internally in our
company to give all team members access to the same set of libraries
at a specific version without having to check out their respective git
repos.

* Included Projects

As we use the [[http://dwim.hu][dwim.hu]] software stack with a small number of patches to
some of them, the dist mainly consists of those projects plus some
others which are e.g. not yet available with quicklisp. This is the
current list of repositories:
